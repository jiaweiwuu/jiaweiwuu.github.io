I'm a first-year PhD student at **Rutgers University–New Brunswick**, advised by Prof. [Hongyi Wang](https://hwang595.github.io/).

My research focuses on the **scalability and efficiency of machine learning algorithms and systems**, with a current emphasis on **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)**.

Previously, I was a research assistant at the [Medical AI Lab, Westlake University](https://medai.lab.westlake.edu.cn/), mentored by Prof. [Yefeng Zheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vAIECxgAAAAJ&hl=en).

I received my B.Sc. from the School of Data Science and Engineering, East China Normal University.

## Research interests

- scalable training and inference
- efficient architectures and routing (MoE)
- optimization and systems for large models
