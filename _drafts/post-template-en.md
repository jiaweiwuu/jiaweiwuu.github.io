## TL;DR

- Problem:
- Idea:
- Result:
- Code (optional):

## Motivation

Why should someone care? What should readers take away?

## Background / Notation

Define symbols, assumptions, and input/output shapes.

## Method (High-level)

Start with intuition, then move to equations. A diagram helps a lot.

## Derivation / Key Equations

$$
\\mathcal{L} = \\mathbb{E}_{q(z\\mid x)}[\\log p(x\\mid z)] - \\mathrm{KL}(q(z\\mid x)\\,\\|\\,p(z))
$$
